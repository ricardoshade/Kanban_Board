# Kanban Board

 ## Description
  This project is a Kanban board web application with a secure authentication system built using Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB, React, and Vite. Users can log in, manage tasks across different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), and log out securely. The authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure communication and access control.

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a Kanban board with a secure login page
WHEN I load the login page
THEN I am presented with form inputs for username and password
WHEN I enter my valid credentials
THEN I am authenticated via JWT and redirected to the Kanban board
WHEN I enter invalid credentials
THEN I see an error message indicating the credentials are incorrect
WHEN I successfully log in
THEN a JWT is stored in the client's local storage for authenticated requests
WHEN I log out
THEN the JWT is removed from local storage and I am redirected to the login page
WHEN I try to access the Kanban board without being authenticated
THEN I am redirected to the login page
WHEN I remain inactive for a defined period
THEN my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page upon my next action
